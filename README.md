# Earnings-Calculator
Calculate estimated earnings for the week using the rostered hours for the retail industry. 
The retail industry in Australia has a different hourly pay rate after 6 pm on weekdays, which the calculator takes into consideration.

Tax is automatically deducted.
The user only needs to enter their shift times for the week and the tax, total hours and total earnings after tax will be calculated.

The hourly rates can be found on this website: [www.retailwages.com.au](https://www.retailwages.com.au/)

Although this was **initially designed for iOS**, a working and live version that can be accessed on the web has been made.
It can be found here: [kittatamsaisaard.com/retail-earnings-calculator](https://kittatamsaisaard.com/retail-earnings-calculator)
